# r4f-data

This is a [Cascalog](https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog)
Application to process the data extrated from the [Embed
Database](http://est.amee.com) to create the charts for [Retrofit
Analysis](http://www.retrofitanalysis.org/).

## Usage

If you have the raw data and a hadoop cluster you can run the uberjar
with hadoop. If you do that then you will have extracted the clean raw
sensor data for the Retrofit for the Future homes from the Embed
Database.

Once you have that raw sensor date, you can use the R code to process the raw data and calculate the emissions per square metre, among other metrics, for each property.
